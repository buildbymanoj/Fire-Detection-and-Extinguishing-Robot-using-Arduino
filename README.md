# -Fire-Detection-and-Extinguishing-Robot-using-Arduino
An autonomous Arduino robot that detects fire using flame sensors and extinguishes it with a servo-controlled water pump. It identifies the flame's direction (front, left, or right), stops, and sprays water using a sweeping motion. Ideal for educational demos and basic fire safety experiments.
